# Project 2.P: Arcade Drive

Level: Beginner
Materials: Computer, WPILib, your imagination
Skill: Programming

- This project will introduce the code structure of a basic Teleop robot project
- You must install the [WPILib suite](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html), to program. If you're on Windows, install the [FRC Driver Station,](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/frc-game-tools.html) and if you're on a [real computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX), install [Conductor](https://github.com/Redrield/Conductor), an open source Driver Station alternative.
- We will primarily be using VSCode as the programming environment, which you can install automatically when you install WPILib. You can also use IntelliJ if you want, but it'll take more setup and I won't help you when you get stupid IntelliJ-related errors.
- Make sure you have a [Git client](https://desktop.github.com/) installed. This will allow us to collaborate on code.
- If you don't know Kotlin and you want to do programming, make sure you spend a bit of time familiarizing yourself. I recommend going through [Head First Kotlin](https://b-ok.cc/book/3709541/18ac03). If you've done programming in the past, especially AP Computer Science A, this will be easier.

This project will require:

- Creating a new WPILib project (VScode can do this automatically)
- Implementing an "Arcade Drive":
    - Right trigger is forward, left trigger is reverse
    - Left joystick is for steering
    - X is for "quickturn"
    - Trigger outputs will give you a value between 0 and 1 - cube this value to give the driver better control

Getting started is the hardest part of FRC programming! Ask Jared, Aryan, Everett, Kevin, Abhi, or Rishita if you need help.
